# Lepton

Lepton is a tool and file format for losslessly compressing JPEGs by an average of 22%.

This can be used to archive large photo collections, or to serve images live and save 22% bandwidth.

## Weissman Score

Tentative Weissman Score = 1.21

Tested via Weissman Score application (https://weissmanscore.ru).

Tested image is Lena image (1920, 1080).

Tested on Macbook Pro 13 2016 (i5, 4 RAM, 256 SSD)


## Build directions
Using a single core

    ./autogen.sh
    ./configure
    make
    make check

For multiprocessor machines:

    ./autogen.sh
    ./configure
    make -j8
    make check -j8

Using CMAKE:

    mkdir -p build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    make -j8

On Windows

    mkdir -p build
    cd build
    "c:\Program Files\CMake\bin\cmake" ..
    start .
    REM Double click the Visual Studio project

## Usage

To roundtrip (compress and decompress) an image, `original.jpg`, do the following:

    ./lepton original.jpg compressed.lep
    ./lepton compressed.lep restored_original.jpg

Or all at once:

    ./lepton original.jpg compressed.lep && ./lepton compressed.lep restored_original.jpg && diff restored_original.jpg original.jpg && echo no differences


Lepton may also be used with pipes -- be sure to check the exit code when using pipes
as if compression fails lepton will produce 0 bytes and return a nonzero exit code
(failure). In this case do not assume the 0 byte file is representative of the original.

    ./lepton - < original.jpg > compressed.lep
    ./lepton - < compressed.lep > restored_original.jpg


You may specify higher memory limits than the default for lepton to handle bigger images:

    ./lepton -memory=1024M -threadmemory=128M input_file output_file

Additionally you can configure lepton to process progressive jpegs.
Warning: these take more memory to decode than normal JPEGs since the entire framebuffer
must be kept in memory for the duration of the decompression, instead of just 2 rows of blocks.

    ./lepton -allowprogressive -memory=1024M -threadmemory=128M progressive.jpg compressedprogressive.lep

## Debugging

Lepton is designed to be easy to debug, but a command line requirement is necessary to prevent
the standard forks that let it do a secure verification in a separate process.

To avoid setting follow fork flags, please pass -skipverify to the command line.
This will stop verification and let you debug the app as a single process application.
If the bug happens in single threaded mode, also you can pass -singlethread which makes
it easier to step through the code without other threads hitting breakpoints.

## Acknowledgements

Many thanks to Matthias Stirner and HTW Aalen University for the development of the [uncmpJPG](http://packjpg.encode.ru/?page_id=178) library.

Thanks to the VPX authors for their highly tuned bool reader and bool writer implementations.

## Related Work

Be sure to read the groundbreaking research done by Matthias Stirner, Gehard Seelman and HTW Aalen University in their [2007 paper](http://www.elektronik.htw-aalen.de/packjpg/_notes/PCS2007_PJPG_paper_final.pdf) and check out their excellent [PackJPG](http://github.com/packjpg) repositories for compression of JPEG MP3 BMP and PMN formats.

Also the [paq](http://mattmahoney.net/dc/) algorithms combine for a highly compressed JPEG result when decompression time is less critical.

When the compressed JPEG needs to also be a JPEG, there is [mozjpg](https://github.com/mozilla/mozjpeg) to explore as well.
